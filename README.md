There are two tiny code tools that can help you to fast the work of paper comparison.
- if you want to delete the same items from the paper list (dirty data), you can use make_unique_items.r
- if you want to regroup the results with different categories, you can use rematch_with_pattern.r

all input data should be the same as the example file listed in this repository.

welcome to leave the questions in issues.
