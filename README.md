This is two tiny code tools that can help you to fast the work of paper comparision.
- if you want to detete the same items from paper list (dirty data), you can use make_unique_items.r
- if you want to regroup the results with different catageries, you can use rematch_with_pattern.r

all input data should be same with the example file listed in this reposity.

welcome to leave the questions in issues.
